# Pair Programming Hackathon

## Overview
This project was created during a 5.5-hour hackathon as part of BrainStation's Software Engineering Bootcamp.
We (C.J. Astronomo & Maria Rodriguez Hertz) were paired together and we won first place out of 15 groups.
The hackathon required that we create a React application and use an API. 
We used Visual Studio Code's Live Share extension to create a murder mystery game and built our own API via an Express server. 
Please note that this project is best viewed at a screen size of 1280px wide x 920px high.

 ### Data
 We created 2 JSON files. One file for the characters/suspects and the other file for items/clues to solve the murder.

 ## Nice-to-haves
 - We would have liked to have created various suspect outcomes so that there is repeat value in playing again
 - We would have liked to have created variables and mixins and finessed the styling
 - We would have liked to have made the design responsive at multiple breakpoints
